Question -> Add two numbers in Python

```
Explanation ->
The given Python script calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user. Let's go through the solution step by step:

a=int(input("Enter the first number: ")): This line prompts the user to enter the first number. The input() function is used to receive user input as a string, and int() is used to convert the input to an integer. The entered value is assigned to the variable a.

b=int(input("Enter the second number: ")): Similar to the previous line, this line prompts the user to enter the second number. The entered value is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable b.

c=a+b: This line calculates the sum of the two numbers by adding the values of a and b. The result is stored in the variable c.

print("The sum is: ", c): Finally, this line prints the sum of the two numbers. The print() function is used to display the output, which includes the string "The sum is: " followed by the value of c.

The script takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and then displays the sum to the user.

# Addition Calculator

This Python program is an addition calculator that prompts the user to enter two numbers and calculates their sum. It then displays the result to the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the first number and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program prompts the user to enter the second number and stores it in the variable `b`.
3. The program adds the values of `a` and `b` together and assigns the result to the variable `c`.
4. Finally, the program displays the sum by printing the value of `c` along with an explanatory message.

## Example Usage

Enter the first number: 5  
Enter the second number: 7

The sum is: 12

# Remainder Calculator

This Python program is a remainder calculator that prompts the user to enter a dividend and a divisor. It calculates the remainder when the dividend is divided by the divisor and displays the result to the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the dividend and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program prompts the user to enter the divisor and stores it in the variable `b`.
3. The program converts the input values to floating-point numbers using the `float()` function, assigning the results to variables `fa` and `fb`.
4. The program calculates the remainder by using the modulus operator `%` on `fa` and `fb`, and assigns the result to the variable `fr`.
5. Finally, the program displays the remainder by printing the value of `fr` along with an explanatory message.

## Example Usage

Dividend is:
23
Divisor is:
5

The remainder is 3

# Variable Type Identifier

This Python program prompts the user to enter a value and then identifies and displays the type of the entered value.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a value and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program uses the `type()` function to determine the type of the variable `a`.
3. Finally, the program prints the value of `a` along with the identified type.

## Example Usage

Enter a value: 42

Type of variable 42 is: <class 'int'>

"Identifying Variable Types in Python"

This program allows users to input a value and determines its variable type using Python's `type()` function. It demonstrates how Python can dynamically assign types to variables based on their values. This program can be useful for debugging or understanding the nature of a given value within a Python program.

# Number Comparison

This Python program prompts the user to enter two numbers and compares them to determine if the first number is greater than the second number. It then displays the result to the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the first number and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program prompts the user to enter the second number and stores it in the variable `b`.
3. The program uses an `if` statement to compare the values of `a` and `b`.
4. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints a message stating that `a` is greater.
5. If `a` is not greater than `b`, the program prints a message stating that `a` is not greater.
6. The program terminates after printing the result.

## Example Usage

Enter the first number: 8  
Enter the second number: 5

8 is greater than 5

"Comparing Two Numbers in Python"

This program allows users to input two numbers and compares them to determine if the first number is greater than the second number using Python. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements and variable comparison. It can be used as a basic building block for more complex decision-making scenarios in Python programs.

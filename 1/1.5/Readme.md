# Calculating the Average of Two Numbers

This Python program prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates their average, and displays the result with two decimal places.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the first number and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program prompts the user to enter the second number and stores it in the variable `b`.
3. The program calculates the average of the two numbers by adding `a` and `b`, then dividing the sum by 2. The result is stored in the variable `avg`.
4. Finally, the program displays the average by using string formatting to round it to two decimal places and printing the result.

## Example Usage

Enter the first number: 5  
Enter the second number: 8

Average of two numbers = 6.50

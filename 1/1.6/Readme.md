# Calculating the Square of a Number

This Python program prompts the user to enter a number, calculates its square, and displays the result.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable `a`.
2. The program calculates the square of the number by multiplying `a` with itself, and assigns the result to the variable `square`.
3. Finally, the program displays the square by printing the value of `a` along with an explanatory message.

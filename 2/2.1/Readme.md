Explanation ->
The given Python code uses a while loop to print a series of numbers starting from 10 and decreasing by 2 until reaching 2. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

a = 10: This line initializes the variable a with the value 10. This will be the starting point of the series of numbers to be printed.

while a >= 2:: This line starts a while loop. The loop will continue executing the indented code block as long as the condition a >= 2 is true.

print(a): Inside the loop, this line prints the value of a. It displays the current value of a in each iteration.

a = a - 2: After printing the value, this line subtracts 2 from the current value of a. It updates the value of a for the next iteration.

The loop will continue executing until the value of a becomes less than 2. In each iteration, it prints the value of a and then subtracts 2 from it. The loop stops when the condition a >= 2 becomes false.
```

The code essentially counts down from 10 to 2 (inclusive) by printing each number in the series.

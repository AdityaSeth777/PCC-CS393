# Multiplication Table Generator

This Python program prompts the user to enter a number and generates the multiplication table for that number, ranging from 1 to 10.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable `number`.
2. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate 10 times, representing the numbers from 1 to 10.
3. Inside the loop, the program prints the multiplication table for the given number by multiplying `number` with the current count.
4. The program displays the multiplication table by printing each multiplication expression in the format: `number x count = result`.

## Example Usage

Enter the number of which the user wants to print the multiplication table: 7

The Multiplication Table of 7  
7 x 1 = 7  
7 x 2 = 14  
7 x 3 = 21  
7 x 4 = 28  
7 x 5 = 35  
7 x 6 = 42  
7 x 7 = 49  
7 x 8 = 56  
7 x 9 = 63  
7 x 10 = 70

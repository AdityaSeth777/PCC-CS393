# String Sorting - Alphabetic Order

This Python program prompts the user to enter a string and prints its characters in alphabetical order.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string and stores it in the variable `s`.
2. It initializes an empty list `l` and converts the string `s` into a list of characters using the `list()` function.
3. The program sorts the list `l` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It then iterates over the sorted list and prints each character using the `print()` function with the `end=""` argument to ensure the characters are printed side by side without a newline character.
5. Finally, the program prints a newline character to move the cursor to the next line.

## Example Usage

Enter the string: openai
aeinop

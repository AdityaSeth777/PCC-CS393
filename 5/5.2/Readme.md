# Copying Specific Elements from One Tuple to Another in Python

This Python program allows the user to enter a tuple and select specific elements to be copied into a new tuple.

## How it Works

1. The program initializes an empty list `L` to store the tuples.
2. It prompts the user to enter the elements of the tuple, separated by commas. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into individual elements, which are then converted into a tuple using the `tuple()` function. The resulting tuple is appended to the list.
3. The program prints the original tuple.
4. It then enters a loop to allow the user to select specific elements for copying into the new tuple. The selected elements are stored in the list `L2`.
5. Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to enter an element. If the entered element is not present in the original tuple, the program requests the user to enter the correct element.
6. The entered element is added to the list `L2`.
7. The program asks the user if they want to continue entering elements or exit the loop.
8. If the user chooses to continue (`y`), the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop breaks and the program moves to the next step.
9. Finally, the program creates a new tuple from the elements stored in `L2` and prints it as the new tuple.

## Example Usage

Enter the first tuple: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
The first tuple is: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Enter the elements you want to copy:
Enter the element: 3
Enter 'y' to continue or end to exit: y
Enter the element: 5
Enter 'y' to continue or end to exit: end
The new tuple is: (3, 5)

"Copying Specific Elements from One Tuple to Another in Python"

This program allows the user to enter a tuple and select specific elements to be copied into a new tuple. It demonstrates the use of tuple manipulation, input validation, and loop control in Python. The program is useful when there is a need to extract and create a new tuple with only certain elements from an existing tuple, based on user input.

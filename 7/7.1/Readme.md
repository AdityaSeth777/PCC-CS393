# Maximum of Three Numbers

This Python program determines the maximum of three numbers.

## How it Works

1. The program defines a function `maximum(a, b, c)` that takes three parameters.
2. Inside the function, it compares the three numbers (`a`, `b`, `c`) using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine the largest number.
3. The largest number is stored in the variable `largest`.
4. The function returns the value of `largest`.
5. The program prompts the user to enter three numbers (`a`, `b`, `c`).
6. It calls the `maximum()` function with the three numbers as arguments and stores the result in a variable.
7. Finally, the program prints the greatest number.

## Example Usage

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 25
Enter the third number: 15
The greatest number is: 25

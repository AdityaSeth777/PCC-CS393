# List Sum

This Python program calculates the sum of a list of integers provided by the user.

## How it Works

1. The program defines a function called `make_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, an empty list `list1` is created to store the elements.
3. Using a `for` loop, the program prompts the user to enter `n` elements one by one, converts them to integers, and appends them to the `list1`.
4. After collecting all the elements, the program initializes a variable `result` to 0, which will store the sum.
5. Using another `for` loop, the program iterates over each element in `list1` and adds it to the `result`.
6. Finally, the `result` is returned from the function.
7. In the main part of the program, the user is prompted to enter the number of integers they want to input and store in the list.
8. The program calls the `make_sum` function with the user-provided value of `n` and prints the returned sum.

## Example Usage

Enter the number of integers: 5
Enter the element: 1
Enter the element: 2
Enter the element: 3
Enter the element: 4
Enter the element: 5
The sum of all the elements in the list is: 15

"Calculating the sum of a list of integers provided by the user"

This program allows users to input a specified number of integers and calculates the sum of those integers. It utilizes a function called `make_sum` to collect the elements and compute their sum. The result is then displayed to the user. The program provides a convenient way to quickly calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
